                      This project is a detailed digital recreation of a DVD player, created to demonstrate precision, attention to detail, and effective use of vector illustration tools in Adobe Illustrator. The objective was to accurately represent a physical product in a digital format, highlighting its structure, components, and visual hierarchy while maintaining correct proportions and scale.                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The primary challenge involved ensuring visual accuracy while designing each element with consistency and clarity. This required careful alignment, spacing, and scaling to reflect how the product functions and appears in real life. Visual effects such as shadows and subtle blurs were applied to enhance depth and realism, helping the design feel more tangible. The completed illustration demonstrates how digital product recreations can be used to evaluate design decisions, communicate product details, and explore potential refinements before physical production.                    </p>

                        A task management application was created to help individuals and small teams organize their workflows more effectively. The application provides users with tools to create, categorize, and track tasks through various stages of completion, addressing the common issue of scattered information across multiple platforms.

                    <p>
                        The design challenge centered on creating an interface that felt lightweight and approachable while offering sufficient organization features. Research indicated users wanted immediate access to their most important tasks without visual clutter. The solution features a minimal design with color-coded categories for quick visual scanning, drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive task organization, and local storage capabilities that preserve data without requiring account creation. The interface prioritizes clarity and efficiency, enabling users to manage their tasks with minimal cognitive load.

                        This website was developed as a team project to help trades workers better understand complex technical manuals and textbooks. The goal was to make dense information more accessible through features such as content simplification, mind mapping, and summarization. The overall layout and interface were intentionally designed to be clear and easy to navigate, ensuring usability for trades workers with limited technical experience.

                        Within the team, my specific responsibilities included designing and building the project blog, which communicates ongoing development progress and updates, as well as creating the settings page for the website. These components were structured to remain consistent with the site’s accessibility goals, prioritizing clarity and ease of use. By working within defined roles and shared objectives, the project demonstrates effective teamwork and the ability to contribute functional, user-focused features to a larger digital platform.

                      DTRMND is a fashion e-commerce platform developed through structured team work, with each member responsible for specific areas of the site. The project was created to address common challenges in online apparel shopping, including uncertainty around fit, product selection, and checkout flow. A virtual try-on feature allows users to preview clothing items on uploaded images, helping support more confident purchasing decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My primary responsibility focused on developing the shopping cart functionality and the checkout page. This included implementing item persistence, quantity management, and a clear, efficient progression from product selection to purchase completion. Design and technical decisions were made to ensure clarity, responsiveness, and consistency with the overall interface. Through defined roles and coordinated effort, the project demonstrates how effective team work can produce a cohesive, functional, and user-centered e-commerce experience.
