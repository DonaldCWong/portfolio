                      This project is a detailed digital recreation of a DVD player, created to demonstrate precision, attention to detail, and effective use of vector illustration tools in Adobe Illustrator. The objective was to accurately represent a physical product in a digital format, highlighting its structure, components, and visual hierarchy while maintaining correct proportions and scale.                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The primary challenge involved ensuring visual accuracy while designing each element with consistency and clarity. This required careful alignment, spacing, and scaling to reflect how the product functions and appears in real life. Visual effects such as shadows and subtle blurs were applied to enhance depth and realism, helping the design feel more tangible. The completed illustration demonstrates how digital product recreations can be used to evaluate design decisions, communicate product details, and explore potential refinements before physical production.                    </p>

                        This project is a canned beverage mockup created to demonstrate attention to detail, proofing accuracy, and brand-driven illustration within strict production constraints. The design is based on a British fruit tea theme, featuring animals dressed in classic European attire to convey a refined yet playful brand identity. Each flavour variation was designed to feel cohesive while maintaining its own visual distinction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A key requirement of the project was ensuring the artwork adhered precisely to the provided production proof. This included maintaining correct dimensions, bleed areas, and layout placement to meet real-world printing standards. Throughout the process, careful consideration was given to scale, alignment, and consistency across all cans. The final mockups demonstrate an understanding of how illustrated branding translates from digital design to physical packaging, while meeting technical specifications required for accurate proofing and production readiness.

                        This website was developed as a team project to help trades workers better understand complex technical manuals and textbooks. The goal was to make dense information more accessible through features such as content simplification, mind mapping, and summarization. The overall layout and interface were intentionally designed to be clear and easy to navigate, ensuring usability for trades workers with limited technical experience.

                        Within the team, my specific responsibilities included designing and building the project blog, which communicates ongoing development progress and updates, as well as creating the settings page for the website. These components were structured to remain consistent with the site’s accessibility goals, prioritizing clarity and ease of use. By working within defined roles and shared objectives, the project demonstrates effective teamwork and the ability to contribute functional, user-focused features to a larger digital platform.

                      DTRMND is a fashion e-commerce platform developed through structured team work, with each member responsible for specific areas of the site. The project was created to address common challenges in online apparel shopping, including uncertainty around fit, product selection, and checkout flow. A virtual try-on feature allows users to preview clothing items on uploaded images, helping support more confident purchasing decisions.

                    <p>
                      My primary responsibility focused on developing the shopping cart functionality and the checkout page. This included implementing item persistence, quantity management, and a clear, efficient progression from product selection to purchase completion. Design and technical decisions were made to ensure clarity, responsiveness, and consistency with the overall interface. Through defined roles and coordinated effort, the project demonstrates how effective team work can produce a cohesive, functional, and user-centered e-commerce experience.
